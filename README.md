"AA-Sensor-Output-to-Meter-demo"
Reads an AA-Series analog magnetometer sensor, amplifies and corrects offset using an 
Arduino Uno. Sensor OUT+ on IO0 and OUT- on IO1. Amplified PWM output on IO3.

"AD-Sensor-LED-demo"
Reads an open-collector AD-Series digital magnetic sensor with an Arduino Uno. 
Sensor output on IO2; the Arduino drives an LED (through a series resistor) on IO13.
